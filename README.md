Mo' Food Mod v1.0 by roastedlasagna
=======================================

This mod changes how hunger and food works in the game.

List of changes:

1. 6 new items added! Bowl of fruit, bowl of rice, bowl, cheeseburger, chips, pizza.
2. 3 food items appear per level instead of 1.
3. All monsters (except swarm of flies and bosses) now can drop mystery meat.
4. Starving hurts more as you go deeper.
5. Mystery meat now can cause a stomach ache or can be ineffective.
6. Mystery meat has a smaller chance for poison and burning.
7. Potions of Liquid Flame more common.
8. Seed of Firebloom drops slightly more often.
9. No special bonus for eating food based on class.
10. Player is not interrupted due to starving unless they have less than 25% health.

This mod makes the game much harder, especially in the beginning. You have been warned.
