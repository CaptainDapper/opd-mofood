Mo' Food Mod by roastedlasagna
=======================================

This mod changes how hunger and food works in the game.

List of v1.0.6 changes:

1. 6 new items added! Bowl of fruit, bowl of rice, bowl, cheeseburger, chips, pizza.
2. 3 food items appear per level instead of 1.
3. All monsters (except swarm of flies and bosses) now can drop mystery meat.
4. Starving hurts more as you go deeper.
5. Mystery meat now can cause a stomach ache or can be ineffective.
6. Mystery meat has a smaller chance for poison and burning.
7. Potions of Liquid Flame more common.
8. Seed of Firebloom drops slightly more often.
9. No special bonus for eating food based on class.
10. Player is not interrupted due to starving unless they have less than 25% health.
11. Mo' Food Mod name added in various places.

List of v1.1.3 changes:

1. Difficulty selector added! Choose between Easy, Normal, Hard, and Insane game modes.
2. Difficulty saves to rankings (and hero screen).
3. Night mode now optional. Choose either always on, always off, or based on time.
4. Fire elementals now dropped Chargrilled Meat.
5. Mo' Food Mod name added in various places.

This mod makes the game much harder, especially in the beginning. You have been warned.

This mod should install as a separate application and will not hurt any of your current
Pixel Dungeon save files. (That said, if something happens to your save files as a result
of download this app I am not responsible)

If you are installing v1.1.3 as an update to v1.0.6, your progress will be saved. However,
there may be a few bugs with games in progress. For best results, do not load games from
v1.0.6 using v1.1.3. (Nothing game-breaking, you may just experience minor bugs.)
